              <p><strong>Voluntary decision-making in the human brain</strong> </p>
              <p>We can all feel the freedom of making choices to fulfil our goals and desires, even when all the options have equal or no expected values. This talk will discuss our recent work on using brain imaging, electrophysiology and modelling to understand the cognitive processes underlying such voluntary choices. First, we used model-based fMRI analysis to show that when making a voluntary choice, a decision network centred in the medial frontal cortex accumulates action intention until a response threshold is reached. Second, I will present recent results on endogenous and exogenous factors that influence voluntary choice behaviour, including tissue microstructure, neurodegeneration, reward certainty and perceptual load. Last, I will show that the randomness in a sequence of voluntary choices fluctuates over time and correlated with both fMRI and MEG activity in the frontopolar cortex. This suggests a spatial distribution of cortical regions sensitive to information regularities, which may concurrently monitor and regulate decision-making. Our results highlight the potential and challenges of establishing a neurobiological theory of voluntary behaviour</p>

              <p><strong>Features or Bugs? Synergistic Idiosyncrasies in Human Learning and Decision-Making</strong> </p>
              <!--<p>How we form memories of our experiences is a fundamental scientific question with broad implications. In the past two decades, human neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies have implicated a distinct set of brain regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus as well as the prefrontal cortex in processes associated with successful memory formation. However, real-world memories are formed based on a continuous stream of information instead of sequentially presented, isolated items used in these and most following studies. Potentially, the stream of life is segmented into distinct events and then integrated into a coherent, episode-based representation of their sequential relationship. Supporting this model, a hippocampal “chunking code” has been recently described in rodents that represents an episode by segmenting events and integrating them within a sequential, meaningful stream (Sun, Yang, Martin, & Tonegawa, 2019). However, relatively little is known about the precise neural correlates underlying segmentation and integration in the human brains. Here, we bolster preliminary evidence that similar neuro-computations also exist in the human hippocampus during memory encoding of real-life experience and can be measured non-invasively by fMRI. More specifically, we reanalysed an existing dataset (Baldassano et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017) that is based on an experiment that participants watched a movie while brain activity was monitored by fMRI and were afterwards instructed to retell the full story without freely. We applied a distinct set of univariate and multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) to quantify neural responses to event boundaries during movie watching and related them to subsequent memory recall. We demonstrate that distinct activations patterns of hippocampus and subregions of prefrontal cortex for the mnemonic representations of events and the beneficial effect of distinct representations. By contrast, we found that similar within-region connectivity patterns across event boundaries of these regions facilitate memory formation and are critical for the temporal order of subsequent events retrieval. We propose that distinct activation patterns are the neural implementations of event segmentation while similar connectivity patterns act as the “neural string” for event integration. Our results reveal different mnemonic functions of activation and connectivity pattern and provided novel evidence to link them with hippocampal event segmentation and integration during episodic memory formation of real-life experience.</p> -->

              <!--<p>We can all feel the freedom of making choices to fulfil our goals and desires, even when all the options have equal or no expected values. This talk will discuss our recent work on using brain imaging, electrophysiology and modelling to understand the cognitive processes underlying such voluntary choices. First, we used model-based fMRI analysis to show that when making a voluntary choice, a decision network centred in the medial frontal cortex accumulates action intention until a response threshold is reached. Second, I will present recent results on endogenous and exogenous factors that influence voluntary choice behaviour, including tissue microstructure, neurodegeneration, reward certainty and perceptual load. Last, I will show that the randomness in a sequence of voluntary choices fluctuates over time and correlated with both fMRI and MEG activity in the frontopolar cortex. This suggests a spatial distribution of cortical regions sensitive to information regularities, which may concurrently monitor and regulate decision-making. Our results highlight the potential and challenges of establishing a neurobiological theory of voluntary behaviour</p> -->
